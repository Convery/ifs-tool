IFS Tool
========

As of version 1.2.1.12, Call of Duty: Online assets have been recompressed/packed into a new archive system called IFS (or so...)  
and yeah, this basically allows you to extract all the files from such an archive.  
Just move the *.ifs file to the same directory as the IFS Tool.exe (make sure you have Tencent's IFS2.dll aswell)  
and drag the .ifs ontop of the .exe. It should extract all the files from it then.

This tool was written as part of the React project (https://react.kthx.at/)
