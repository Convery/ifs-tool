IFS Tool
========

As of version 1.2.1.12, Call of Duty: Online assets have been recompressed/packed into a 'new' archive system called IFS (or so...)  
This tool allows you to extract all the files from such archives.  
Just drag the *.ifs files ontop of the 'IFS Tool.exe' (make sure you have Tencent's IFS2.dll aswell)  
It should extract all the files from the archives then.

This tool was written as part of the React project (https://react.kthx.at/)
